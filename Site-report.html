            <p>I am about to talk about the report. I got a chance to learn so many things about coding and a lot of
                software and servers.furthermore i would like to talk about the coding system and how it works and how
                was my experience in the beginning phase about learning how to use a variety of structures and tags
                which have been discussed below.

                First of all, I am going to talk about my learning process. 2 months ago. I began coding by using simple
                tags in html. However, it was very complicated for me to understand.then i did not lose my hope so i
                have tried to use so many html tags and css tags. Moreover,

                I used many decorating tags in order to make my website more vibrant. Several websites helped me a lot
                in becoming like this in coding. Because of W3 school, I learned so many more things than I would have
                learned from books. One month ago I attended a coding class and there was a consultancy near my house
                where they offered programming courses. When I was starting out, websites like wildlearner.com,
                sonarsource.com, and criodo.com were quite educational and helpful. It was extremely difficult for me at
                the time to comprehend each and every structure used in programming. I started from scratch and within
                two months became what I am today. My first form and format creation was simple, and as I learned to use
                templates, my skill level increased. Furthermore, I learned some basic programming skills by using HTML
                and CSS to create a table. I'm still learning, so I believe I'll be able to improve my skills in this
                field over time.</p>
