                <h2>AASHISH KARKI</h2>
                <p>It is my great pleasure to introduce myself to you as Aashish Karki. My family and I live in
                    Kathmandu, but I hail from Dolakha district.

                    My secondary education was completed at Gems College in 2021. Software is what I am studying at the
                    moment at NAMI College.

                    I am passionate about science and technology. My interest in technology began at an early age

                    Technology is a big part of our lives now, and I have always had a keen interest in it since I was a
                    child.<br />

                    The computers when I was in grade 7 I started coding. My elder brother used to help in order to be

                    Good at coding. I did not want to waste my precious time thatâ€™s why I would practice 6 hours in a

                    Day, even though we had a low level version of the computer and a poor internet connection. On top
                    of that

                    Each and

                    Every sector are related to technology and computer in current scenario so I chose this profession.

                    Ambition is to be a professional front-end developer.
