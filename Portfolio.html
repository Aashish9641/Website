                <h2>AASHISH KARKI</h2>
                <p>My full name is Aashish karki. I hail from Dolakha district, but I put up in Kathmandu with my
                    parents. I
                    've completed my secondary level from gems college in 2021. At the moment I am studying Software
                    engineering in NAMI College.<br />
                    I have keen intrested in science and technical filed. I have been learning technology since my hand
                    the world is full of technology and science. Since my early childhood I was really intrested into
                    the computers when I was in grade 7 I stared coding. My elder brother used to help in order to be
                    good in coding. I did not want to waste my precious time thatâ€™s why I would practice 6 hours in a
                    day, even though we had a low level version of computer and poor internet connection. On top of that
                    each and
                    every sector are related to technology and computer in current scenario so I chose this field.my
                    ambition is to be a professional front end developer.
