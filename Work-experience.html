                <h3> 9 years Work-experience in cashier field.</h3>
                <p>My name is aashish karki, and I have worked as an employee at angan sweets for the past 9 years.
                    First of all, I had very proficient computer knowledge and communication skills, as I had to deal
                    with wages
                    and customer service. I have a great deal of experience in this field, and I will share my entire
                    experience
                    below. Throughout my childhood, I was a brilliant student. My father suggested me to fill the form
                    in the posgt of cashier vacancy. When I decided to take the interview exam i had to speak in english
                    infront of the
                    interviewer. I had outstanding marks at my schooling and intermediate grades. Furthermore, I was
                    selected out of 9 candidates and began working as a cashier at angan sweets.<br />
                    It was my job to deal with customers and wages. Initially, I worked 8 hours a day. Sometimes I would
                    visit the different Angan branches and I was awarded the finest employee of the year in 2012.i have
                    very substantial experience in the cashier field. As a substitute, we relied on IMS software, which
                    is a business-related program. Working with sweets for customers helped me develop software,
                    communication skills, computing, and coding skills. The owner increased my salary and appreciated my
                    work after that. It had been agreed that I would not leave the job for a decade, and I have been
                    trying my best to do this for the past 10 years.
