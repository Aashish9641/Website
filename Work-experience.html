                <h3> 9 years Work-experience in cashier field.</h3>
                <p>My name is aashish karki, and I have worked as an employee at angan sweets for the past 9 years.
                    First of
                    all, I had very proficient computer knowledge and communication skills, as I had to deal with wages
                    and
                    customer service. I have a great deal of experience in this field, and I will share my entire
                    experience
                    below.

                    Throughout my childhood, I was a brilliant student. My father suggested me to fill the form in the
                    post
                    of cashier vacancy. When I decided to take the interview exam i had to speak in english infront of
                    the
                    interviewer. I had outstanding marks at my schooling and intermediate grades. Furthermore, I was
                    selected out of 9 candidates and began working as a cashier at angan sweets.
